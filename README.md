# FASTA_file_manipulation
First task:
Create a user interface that accepts a fasta file and checks three constraints:
a) the information line starts with ">" symbol
b) the information is contained a single line, if the information extends to two or more lines, show an error message
c) the gene should contain only 4 letters A,T,G,C and none other than these, otherwise show an error message

Once all the three conditions are satisfied, give the user a download option to download the file in a specific format given in this folder as "output format"
